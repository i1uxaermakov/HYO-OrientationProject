# NewsAnalyzer

NewsAnalyzer project allows to see what words dominate the titles of the articles within a specific time frame in the politics section of major news outlets. This repository is for the backend code of the project.

A deployed version of the project is available at https://peaceful-kalam-af1ea1.netlify.app/about

The data from news outlets is collected using Python web-scraping scrypt. The data is then saved into a database; it can be accessed using an API or can be presented on a React-powered website (link above).
